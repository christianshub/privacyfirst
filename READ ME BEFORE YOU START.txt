	I've made a few notes on the functions that need some manual input or are more likely to cause issues.
	
==============================================================================

******** CREATE SYSTEM RESTORE POINT (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED) ********
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are not tech-savvy, create a restore point just in case anything breaks.
You can easily restore instead of trying to troubleshoot a simple issue for hours...
or days....


******** SETUP VPN (OpenVPN with NordVPN) ********
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
Nothing you do matters if you don't setup OpenVPN with NordVPN. The privacy tool just won't work, because you will get linked by your network adapter.

We don't use the VPN just for the IP address, the main reason is that we utilize its virtual adapter and customize it via a config to privacy tool the network part.

IF FOR WHATEVER REASON THIS STEP DON'T WORK THEN DO THE FOLLOWING:
- Run the Setup VPN option on PrivacyFirst, choose the country and server, and it will create a config.
- Download and install this version of OpenVPN: https://openvpn.net/connect-docs/connect-for-windows.html
- Then go to the PrivacyFirst Final folder -> Configs, and either double click on the config or drag and drop it into the OpenVPN window,
or run OpenVPN connect, click the + icon, click the file tab, choose browse, and locate the file. 
- You should be good to go.

To find your Service Account Details to enter on OpenVPN do the following:
- Go to NordVPN official website: https://go.nordvpn.net/<affiliate-link>
- Login with your account and make sure you have an active premium subscription.
- Then visit this page: https://my.nordaccount.com/dashboard/nordvpn/manual-configuration/service-credentials/
- Click on Service Credentials
- It will ask you to verify your email, do that and then you will be able to see the Username and Password.
- Copy those and put them on OpenVPN and click on Remember, so you don't have to do this every time.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------

******** CHANGE MAC ADDRESS ********
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Will work for 99% of Ethernet adapters.
Wi-Fi really depends. If you get errors on Wi-Fi, then switch to Ethernet and change the MAC address of it.

******** CHANGE MONITOR HWID ********
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should work without issues. If you have multiple monitors, don't change everything at one time.
Change one, restart, see if everything is good, then do the other.

******** HIDE PERIPHERAL SERIAL NUMBERS ********
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In most games, this is not needed.
Again, don't do every single device or you will crash your PC.
Find the main ones: Keyboard, Mouse, Headphones, Controller and hide them.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

******** Important to know ********

One very important thing to note is that a lot of games have started linking to bans via Discord.
So we've added an Unlink Discord function.
Use it to be safe. If you need Discord, make sure to uninstall it and use a new account.
